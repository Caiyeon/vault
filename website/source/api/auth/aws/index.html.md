# AWS Auth Backend HTTP API

This is the API documentation for the Vault AWS authentication backend. For
general information about the usage and operation of the AWS backend, please
see the [Vault AWS backend documentation](/docs/auth/aws.html).

This documentation assumes the AWS backend is mounted at the `/auth/aws`
path in Vault. Since it is possible to mount auth backends at any location,
please update your API calls accordingly.
